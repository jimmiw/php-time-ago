Inspired by the comments at: http://dk.php.net/time and http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/DateHelper.html#M001695

Using this scheme to determine the "ago" time:

<pre><code>
  0 <-> 29 secs                                                             # => less than a minute
  30 secs <-> 1 min, 29 secs                                                # => 1 minute
  1 min, 30 secs <-> 44 mins, 29 secs                                       # => [2..44] minutes
  44 mins, 30 secs <-> 89 mins, 29 secs                                     # => about 1 hour
  89 mins, 29 secs <-> 23 hrs, 59 mins, 29 secs                             # => about [2..24] hours
  23 hrs, 59 mins, 29 secs <-> 47 hrs, 59 mins, 29 secs                     # => 1 day
  47 hrs, 59 mins, 29 secs <-> 29 days, 23 hrs, 59 mins, 29 secs            # => [2..29] days
  29 days, 23 hrs, 59 mins, 30 secs <-> 59 days, 23 hrs, 59 mins, 29 secs   # => about 1 month
  59 days, 23 hrs, 59 mins, 30 secs <-> 1 yr minus 1 sec                    # => [2..12] months
  1 yr <-> 2 yrs minus 1 secs                                               # => about 1 year
  2 yrs <-> max time or date                                                # => over [2..X] years
